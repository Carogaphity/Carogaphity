- 👋 Hi, I’m Carogaph! I use any pronouns, Them/Them works fine. (Femboy)

I'm into modding and little projects like that, and spend a lot of my time in video games. If you're seeing this, it's probably because of my Discord bot that allows you to play Geometry Dash in discord.

Reach me on discord at @carogaph_! It's my handle on most platforms.

I know Python, Lua, Rust, nim, a bit of C++, and am interested in HTML and Javascript.

Much love! ❤️
